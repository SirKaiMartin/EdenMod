/**
 * Assigns a deterministic 1-based occurrence index to repeated identical events
 * within a short rolling window. Used for guild-bank events so depositing the same
 * item several times in a row stays distinct (3 deposits = seq 1..3) instead of
 * being collapsed by content-based dedup.
 *
 * <p>Every connected mod sees the same chat in the same order, so within the window
 * they compute the same seq for a given occurrence — and the backend's cross-client
 * dedup collapses the same physical event seen by multiple clients. The window is
 * deliberately short so that <em>stale</em> earlier deposits (which different clients
 * may or may not have witnessed, depending on when they connected) don't inflate the
 * count differently across clients and cause duplicate Discord messages.
 *
 * <p>A tiny re-emit guard also coalesces the exact same line delivered twice in
 * quick succession (a single physical event re-sent in the same tick) onto one seq.
