/**
 * Records who was physically present while a raid was running, so a completion can name the
 * players the chat announcement leaves out.
 *
 * <p>Wynncraft only names <em>your own guild's</em> members in a raid completion. A raid
 * cannot start without four players, so a completion naming fewer than four was run with
 * allies, and {@code 4 - named} is exactly how many are missing. Their names appear nowhere
 * in chat.
 *
 * <p>They are recovered by proximity rather than by reading the sidebar, the same way war
 * attendance is collected: while a raid is running, the players loaded around the client are
 * sampled periodically and their appearances counted. On completion the announced party is
 * subtracted from that tally and the most-seen remainder fills the gap.
 *
 * <p>Proximity is used because it is the only source that yields <em>account</em> names. The
 * sidebar shows nicknames, and nothing on those rows maps a nickname back to the account
 * behind it. A player entity carries a game profile, and that profile is the real account —
 * a nickname is a display layer painted over it. Reading names off entities means there is
 * no nickname to undo.
 *
 * <p>Proximity is a fair proxy here in a way it would not be in the open world: a raid is an
 * instance containing only its own party. Counting appearances rather than taking a single
 * snapshot covers the two ways that breaks down — someone briefly out of render distance in
 * another room is still seen across the rest of the raid, and a passer-by caught on the way
 * in is not.
 *
 * <p>What proximity cannot rule out is that Wynncraft dresses some NPCs as players, and a
 * stationary one is present for every sample of the raid. So this class does not try to
 * pick the allies; it produces a ranked shortlist and the backend picks, because deciding
 * needs the guild member list and the player API. That also settles the NPCs: an NPC is not a
 * Wynncraft account, so the ally lookup finds nothing and drops it.
