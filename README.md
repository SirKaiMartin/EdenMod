# EdenMod

A client-side Minecraft **1.21.11** Fabric mod that powers the live Discord ↔
in-game guild-chat bridge for the Eden guild. It captures Wynncraft guild chat,
forwards it to the **EdenBot** backend over an authenticated
WebSocket, and renders relayed Discord messages in-game. Account linking uses
Wynncraft v3 OAuth2.

## Build

Requires JDK 21 on your `PATH`.

```bash
./gradlew build        # Windows: gradlew.bat build
```

The installable jar is then at `build/libs/edenmod-*.jar`.

## Usage

1. Press **B** (rebindable in Controls, or open the config from
   [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) if installed) to open the Eden
   Bridge screen.
2. Click **Link account** (you can also change the backend url here, if needed).
3. Your browser opens the Wynncraft authorization page; approve it. When it says
   "Linked", return to Minecraft.
4. Join Wynncraft. While you are on a `*.wynncraft.com` server and linked, guild
   chat is bridged both ways automatically.

Config persists to `config/edenmod.json`. The bridge only runs on Wynncraft
servers and tears down when you leave; switching Minecraft accounts drops the
session so one account's token cannot be reused by another.

### In-game commands

Run `/eden help` in-game for the full command list.
Highlights include `/eden party` for raid parties and `/eden anni` for Annihilation parties.

## Wynncraft ToS considerations

This mod reads guild chat that is already shown to the player and relays it to a
Discord channel the guild controls; it does not automate gameplay, send chat
on the player's behalf into the game, or grant any in-game advantage. Even so,
chat relays and client mods touch areas Wynncraft's rules speak to:

- Only run on official Wynncraft servers; the mod gates on `*.wynncraft.com`.
- It does not modify, suppress, or inject in-game chat, and it never auto-sends
  messages into Minecraft — Discord messages are display-only.
- Members opt in by installing the mod and linking their own account; account
  linking is per-user via official Wynncraft OAuth2.
